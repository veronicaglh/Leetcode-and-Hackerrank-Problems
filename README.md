###### HackerRank, LeetCode and Codeforces are places where programmers from all over the world come together to solve different programming problems.
###### This is a repository dedicated to solving problems on HackerRank, LeetCode and Codeforces
###### I have also attached a link to each problem solved so it is possible to access the problem and attempt to solve it.
###### However, in order to access and solve the problems you will need to sign up for an account on their website. 
###### Please run the code on LeetCode/HackerRanks/Codeforces own code editor. 
###### If you try to run it on your own IDE the code will not work.
